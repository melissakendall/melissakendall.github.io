2024 was an exciting year for me!

* I published 2 books
* Gained thousands of followers on social media
* Attended 2 book events
* Got a 3 book deal

2024 was also the year I experimented with boosting my TikTok videos. In total, I boosted 15 TikTok videos.

## Takeaways

Here are my general thoughts:

* I got more views when I boosted for followers, and I did not lose many followers over time. However, most of the new followers do not engage with my other videos.
* I got more likes and saves when I boosted for views.
* The best time for me to boost a video is 24 hours after I post it because that is when my videos reach their max organic views.
* The best videos for me to boost are videos that already have a few comments at the 24 hour mark.
* The videos that got me the most engagement were celebrating a success (book deal, ranking on Amazon, etc).
* Unsurprisingly, the best performing videos had better lighting/framing/etc.
* I got the most "bonus" views (23%) when boosting a friends video.
* It takes 12-18 hours for a boost to really pick up speed.
* TikTok offers me a lot of boost coupons. I rarely use them because they are for higher prices ($20+).
