Have you seen how many people are buying converted vans or RVs lately? looks like this is going to be the summer of road trips, I am watching no less than three YouTubers convert or renovate vans so they can tour Canada or the United States. 

For the next two weeks I am getting ready for Camp NaNo starting on April 1st! That means reading lots of romance, which is my favorite genre.
