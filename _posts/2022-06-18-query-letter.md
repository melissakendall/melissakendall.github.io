botmblurb: Z Unit doesn't exist. So a knock on the door on Christmas Day brings more
  than one surprise to the special ops band of brothers. <br>Lincoln 'Ace' Kelly has traded
  everything for command of his unit and the girl who saved his life—even if she's
  furry and sleeps on the floor. Every year at Christmas the boys of his unit put
  extra chairs around the table for the ones they’ve lost. <br>Next year, Lucas expects
  to see new faces around the table and a whole lot more chairs. <br>When Hadleigh Rawson
  knocks on his door on Christmas Day, Lucas is reminded of what Christmas is about—gratitude
  for the band of soldiers who are more like brothers than employees, good food, better
  company and the hope that an old grunt might be worthy of redemption and love.

This month, I'm sharing the query letter, pitch, and other marketing material for MARKED that helped me sell it to Wild Rose Press.

### Query letter

Elena Cain has no patience for the dead. 

They manifest on her skin as living tattoos, called shades, and fill her mind with cries for help.

She suppresses her power and tries to ignore the shades, until dire financial straits summon her back to her hometown, where she finds her childhood friend floating face down in her pool. 

The police call it an accident.

The newly formed tattoo on her chest says otherwise.

Determined to bring the murderer to justice, Elena teams up with the one man who will believe her--the victim's brother, Sebastian. 

As the spark between them kindles into an inferno, they discover the murder is only the latest in a series, and Elena has become the killer's next target.

MARKED FOR HARVEST is a standalone paranormal romance complete at 55,000 words with series potential. 

I am a technical writer with a passion for public speaking living in the heart of the Canadian prairies with my two cats, Ella and Portage. My short story, Feast, was published in Sanitarium Magazine, Issue #4.
