As you might have noticed, I've recently started watching Supernatural for the first time. In my latest episode reaction I mentioned I have a playlist of TV shows and movies I watch every Christmas. Someone asked for that list, so here it is, along with one for Halloween!

## My Christmas Playlist

* "A Very Supernatural Christmas": Supernatural (S3E8)
* "Secret Santa": Castle (S5E9)
* "A Tale of Two Santas": Futurama (2001)
* "Xmas Story": Futurama (1999)
* "How the Ghosts Stole Christmas": The X-Files (S6E6) 
* "Amends": Buffy the Vampire Slayer (S3E10)
* "The Constant": Lost (S4E5)
* The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)
* Batman Returns (1992)
* How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000)
* Rise of the Guardians (2012)

## My Halloween Playlist

I have a particular love of anthology movies.

* "Halloween": Buffy the Vampire Slayer (S2E6)
* "Fear Itself": Buffy the Vampire Slayer (S4E4)
* "Demons": Castle (S4E6)
* "Scared to Death": Castle (S5E17)

* Treehouse of Horror: Simpsons (All episodes)
* Halloweentown (1998)
* Halloweentown II: Kalabar's Revenge (2001)
* Halloweentown High (2004): This one is great but the 4th movie is not worth watching.
* Tales of Halloween (2015)
* Tower of Terror (1997): Underrated movie!
* Trick R Treat (2007)
* Holidays (2016)
* The Mortuary Chronicles (2019)
* Tales From the Darkside (1990)
* Creepshow (1982)
