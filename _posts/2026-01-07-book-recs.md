This page holds my book/movie/TV show reccomendations based on episodes of Supernaturaal. These were originally given in videos and posts on Instagram and Threads as part of my Supernatural episode reactions series.

I usually update this page as I finish each season, so if you see a season still TBD it is because I have not finished that season yet.

At a later time I will update this with more features, including book covers and Supernatural episode titles. If you want to make a Google Sheet with this information and share it, you have my blessing!
