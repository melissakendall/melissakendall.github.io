Today, I learned an important lesson... for the second time. When I was in high school, one of my teachers had a tradition. During the first week of class he would pick a day where everyone was working, and then shut off the breaker to the room. Anyone who had not been saving their work would lose everything. Today I lost an hour's worth of writing because I trusted a new piece of software and didn't realize it was not automatically backing up my work! Learn from my mistake, back up your work or risk losing it all.

We have been experimenting with meal kits lately. Chef's Plate is the one I started with. It's a little pricey, and I feel like I'm destroying the environment every time I open the multitude of tiny plastic bags, but it's nice to save time and energy. After a few weeks of using it I found a local equivalent that uses local ingredients and considerably less packaging, so I will be switching to them soon!
