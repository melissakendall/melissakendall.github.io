The past month has been an adventure in cooking. I am dusting off recipes I haven't touched in years, rediscovering how much I love working with my hands.

Is anyone else suddenly possessed by the desire to make sourdough? My Instagram is full of beautiful crusty loaves, and YouTube insists I would love this next video on how to make a starter from potatoes and water. Between the bread and the beer the house is going to smell like yeast for the foreseeable future. Maybe that's not such a bad thing.

On the writing side, I finished drafting a YA based on the Sherlock Holmes story "The Problem of Thor Bridge", but I still need a name. If you have suggestions, please let me know!
