Is it Thursday or Friday?

I can't wait until I can start traveling again. The news is saying this is going to be the summer of road trips. I would be on board for that! Right now I could really do with a shopping spree in the West Edmonton Mall, or even just hanging out in Polo Park Mall in Winnipeg. 

I broke out my old Nintendo DS this week and have been playing some games from the early 2000s, in particular Might and Magic. It holds up pretty well considering how old it is. Do you have any favorite games? Board games, video games, handheld console games. I love all of them.
