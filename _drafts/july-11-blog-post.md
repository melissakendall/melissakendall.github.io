botmblurb: Penny Briggs is a perfectly ordinary woman. Until her life takes a left
  turn at Albuquerque…<br>I thought my marriage would be a fairy tale. Instead, I’ve
  put a thousand miles between me and my broken dream, starting over with temp job
  in Albuquerque. Prop shopping for a TV production takes my mind off my troubles
  — until I buy an old pair of glasses no one on the set can wear.<br>Curious, I look
  through the lenses myself — and they show me a wild vision of a lonely desert canyon
  I’ve never seen before.<br>A friend directs me and my weird glasses to her cousin,
  a brujo — a male witch — who specializes in weird. He’s also the most spectacularly
  handsome man I’ve ever seen, with black hair, dark eyes, and a flashing smile so
  dazzling, I almost miss his casual remark that my magic is powerful.<br>Magic? What
  magic? I’m just an ordinary woman from an ordinary family.<br>Yet as the two of
  us explore the mystery surrounding those supernatural glasses — and give in to our
  growing attraction — I discover a past I knew nothing about. And that there’s a
  dangerous reason it’s been hidden from me all these years….
