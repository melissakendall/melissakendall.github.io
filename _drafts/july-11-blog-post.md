botmblurb: Ben Brickman, owner of Sundae Dreaming, spent years chasing his dreams
  against his family’s wishes. Now that he’s achieved them he can’t wait for Sundays.
  That’s the day he makes a special sundae for his favorite customer, Sammie. But
  more than anything, he wants to get to know her. Sammie Leyton has always been a
  dreamer. But her father’s illness keeps her locked down in a family business that
  she clings to out of a sense of loyalty. Sammie’s only break is her treat once each
  week at the local ice cream parlor. There, she releases her desire to sketch the
  holiday makers at their happiest and daydream about the owner, Ben Brickman. Family
  complications of his own drive Ben to push Sammie to pursue her dreams as he finally
  gathers his courage to ask her out, but is the pressure they place on themselves
  too high for their budding romance to break through?
