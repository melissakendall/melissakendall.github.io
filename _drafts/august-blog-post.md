botmblurb: Penny Briggs is a perfectly ordinary woman. Until her life takes a left
  turn at Albuquerque…<br>I thought my marriage would be a fairy tale. Instead, I’ve
  put a thousand miles between me and my broken dream, starting over with temp job
  in Albuquerque. Prop shopping for a TV production takes my mind off my troubles
  — until I buy an old pair of glasses no one on the set can wear.<br>Curious, I look
  through the lenses myself — and they show me a wild vision of a lonely desert canyon
  I’ve never seen before.<br>A friend directs me and my weird glasses to her cousin,
  a brujo — a male witch — who specializes in weird. He’s also the most spectacularly
  handsome man I’ve ever seen, with black hair, dark eyes, and a flashing smile so
  dazzling, I almost miss his casual remark that my magic is powerful.<br>Magic? What
  magic? I’m just an ordinary woman from an ordinary family.<br>Yet as the two of
  us explore the mystery surrounding those supernatural glasses — and give in to our
  growing attraction — I discover a past I knew nothing about. And that there’s a
  dangerous reason it’s been hidden from me all these years….

This month, I'm sharing the successful query letter, pitch, and other marketing material for Companion to the Count.

### Query letter

Dear [Agent Name],

London, 1860. Saffron Summersby lost everything when her brother disappeared; her dresses, her dowry, her place in society. So when she sees her brother's face in the latest painting from famous anonymous artist Ravenmore, she comes up with a plan—learn the identity of the painter, find her brother, and restore her family to its former glory. 

She doesn't expect the investigation to lead her into the den of a notorious rake. 

After the death of his sister, Leopold “Leo” Mayweather gave up his wild ways and vowed never to love again. He devotes his time to keeping his sister's memory alive, distributing her paintings to local museums under the pseudonym Ravenmore. So when a rumor leads him to discover that someone is stealing his sister's paintings and replacing them with forgeries, he decides to set a trap. 

He doesn't expect a beautiful woman to come barging into his office, determined to unmask him.

Sparks fly when a carriage accident throws Saffron and Leo together on the eve of a country party. Fearing she will disrupt his plans, Leo agrees to introduce Saffron to Ravenmore in exchange for her silence and her assistance finding the thief. But when a series of suspicious accidents threaten Saffron's life, she will need Leo's help to uncover the truth of her brother's disappearance before she becomes the next missing person.

COMPANION TO THE COUNT is an Adult historical romance complete at 60,000 words and will appeal to fans of Emily Sullivan's *A Rogue to Remember* and Bethany Bennett's *Any Rogue Will Do*.

I am a technical writer with a passion for public speaking living in the heart of the Canadian prairies with my two cats, Ella and Portage. My short story, Feast, was published in Sanitarium Magazine, Issue #4. My debut adult paranormal romance will be published with Wild Rose Press in 2023.

Thank you for your consideration.
