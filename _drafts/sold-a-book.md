I'm excited beyond words to announce that my adult paranormal romance, Marked for Harvest, has found a home with [The Wild Rose Press](https://wildrosepress.com/)!

This has been a long journey, so here are some of the highlights:

* August, 2018: Decide to start writing fanfiction.
* October, 2018: Get irrationally angry at a review and decide to "show them" by writing my own original story.
* November, 2018: Finish writing first draft of Marked for NaNoWriMo. 
* January, 2019: Submit Marked to several edits and agents, receive many rejections.
* March-July, 2019: Write a sequel to Marked called Deadly Harvest.
* August 2019-September 2021: Write three other books. (Companion to the Count, The Problem of Thor High, Soulbound)
* August, 2021: Receive an R&R for Marked!
* October, 2021: Work with an amazing editor to rewrite Marked, but the R&R eventually turns into a very kind rejection.
* January, 2022: Submit Marked to The Wild Rose Press.
* May, 2022: Accepted by The Wild Rose Press!

I look forward to sharing more soon!
