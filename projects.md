On this page you will find some examples of the work I've done.

* [Historical Clothing Generator](/dress-generator) - Generate a random description of a dress from the Victorian era. The data used to make this was scraped from museum archive descriptions. Now with Western clothing descriptions!
* [Sense Generator](/sense-generator) - Generates a random set of sensory words. I added this because I always forget to add these to my scenes.
* [Sherlock Game](https://melissakendall.github.io/mystery-game/index.html) - A Sherlock Holmes style game based on [221b Baker Street Master Detective](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1275/221b-baker-street-master-detective-game), I wrote the stories, clues and solutions myself.
* [Scooby Doo Movie Reviews](/scooby-doo) - Nothing technical here, just Scooby Doo movie reviews!
* [Historical Romance Tropes by Book](/tropes) - A list of historical romance novels organized by tropes.
