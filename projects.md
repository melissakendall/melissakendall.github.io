On this page you will find some examples of the work I've done.

* [Historical Clothing Generator](/dress-generator) - Generate a random description of a dress from the Victorian, England era (1860-2019). The data used to make this was scraped from museum archive descriptions. Now with Western clothing descriptions!
* [Sense Generator](/sense-generator) - Generates a random set of sensory words. I added this because I always forget to add these to my scenes.
  * Technology: jQuery, nunjucks
* [Sherlock Game](https://melissakendall.github.io/mystery-game/index.html) - A Sherlock Holmes style game based on [221b Baker Street Master Detective](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1275/221b-baker-street-master-detective-game), I wrote the stories, clues and solutions myself.
  * Technology: GitHub pages, Bootstrap, Firebase (note: the current version is hard coded while I transition to Firestore)
* [Scooby Doo Movie Reviews](/scooby-doo) - Nothing technical here, just Scooby Doo movie reviews!
