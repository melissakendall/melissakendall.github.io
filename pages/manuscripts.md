An exterminator encounters a pest that begs for its life.

### Blurb

Exxo once slaughtered thousands of the crab-like Mossoi in battlefields across the galaxy. Now, her only battles involve capturing mechanical pests that infest her clients' homes.

It's the year 2055 and eradicating the Mossoi has earned humanity a mysterious resource, Gel, which can be synthesized into anything an exterminator needs; food, clothing, even replacement organs. 

Exxo struggles to keep up with the rising price of Gel, until a client referral earns her a lucrative job in the rich neighborhood of Pleasant Hills. There, she encounters a bot that says something she can't ignore.

The Mossoi are back.

Determined to make up for her war-time mistakes, Exxo smuggles the bot out of Pleasant Hills. Together, they risk their lives to discover the truth behind the Mossoi war and along the way learn the horrifying truth of what Gel really is.
