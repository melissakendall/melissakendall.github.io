<!-- TODO: Add books2read -->

Tropes: Victorian era, vampires, mistress to lover, bucket list, spicy mirror scene, strangers to lovers, age gap, fated mates, masquerade.

After fifty wearisome years of searching for his fated mate, vampire Cordon Shaw, Viscount Grayson, compiles a list of activities to complete before the lack of a mating bond kills him. In his pursuit of some sense of satisfaction, he stumbles upon a gorgeous woman who rebuffs his advances—and so he can’t resist relieving her of the box containing a beautiful scarf tucked in her pocket. Then he receives an invitation to visit the shop of the same woman whose name is carved on the lid of the item he stole.

Respectable dressmaker Kitty Carter is determined to make her business prosper, even if it means making sacrifices, such as not chasing after the handsome thief who harassed her in the market. When she learns the mistress of a viscount had a public fight with her modiste, she writes to the viscount directly to petition his patronage. Then he arrives with her stolen scarf wrapped around his neck.

She valiantly holds her tongue during the appointment despite his constant teasing, only for him to cancel the entire order and instead offer to pay her for each scandalous task she helps him complete. It’s an absurd proposition, but she cannot refuse, especially after a thug demands she repay the loan her parents took out to help her open her shop. But as steamy encounters in opera boxes and hedge mazes turn into awkward afternoon tea with her family and meeting his unusual siblings at midnight rituals, Kitty must decide what to prioritize: the allure of short-term pleasure, or the chance for enduring happiness.

After ten years of searching for a cure to the panic attacks that have kept him trapped in a remote Scottish castle, Marcus Deville, the Earl of Kingsberry, struggles to establish dominance and maintain the emotional distance necessary to keep his vampire siblings from killing each other. So, when he mistakenly receives an impassioned complaint intended for his publishing company, he cannot resist writing back and embarks on a secret months-long correspondence with an equally lonely woman in Toronto.

Aspiring scholar Winifred Belltree longs for the freedom to research natural disasters, even if the only person who appreciates her interest is a solitary inventor living thousands of miles away. So, when her mother threatens to sell every book in their library if she doesn’t find a husband by the end of the season, she expresses her frustration to the earl, only for him to offer a solution to both of their problems: a marriage of convenience.

Winifred agrees, despite her family’s concerns about her new husband’s nocturnal schedule. But as late-night experiments and days exploring an impressive library turn into socialization practice sessions designed to help him manage his attacks, Marcus and Winifred must decide what matters more: their passions—or their hearts.
