| Movie | Rating | Notes |
|:------|:-------|:------|
| Scooby-Doo Meets the Boo Brothers |  |  |
| Scooby-Doo and the Ghoul School |  |  |	
| Scooby-Doo! and the Reluctant Werewolf |  |  |
| Scooby-Doo! in Arabian Nights |  |  |
| Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island | 9.5/10 | A classic. The monsters are real this time! This movie changed everything, and set Scooby Doo down the path it is on now. |
| Scooby-Doo! and the Witch's Ghost | 8.5/10 | This one probably doesn't deserve this high of a rating but this movie was given to me by a relative when I was a kid and I've watched it hundreds of times. The Hex Girls! Great songs! |
| Scooby-Doo and the Alien Invaders | 9/10 | Shaggy gets a romantic interest, and I wish they had kept her! She is amazing! Great songs, great animation, great story, great ending. It's so sweet and wholesome. |
| Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase | 6/10 | Some people like it, others don't. I enjoyed the idea, and seeing our characters in new situations. But it was pretty silly. |
| Scooby-Doo! and the Legend of the Vampire |  |  |
| Scooby-Doo! and the Monster of Mexico | 2/10 | Boring, predictable. Borderline offensive. |
| Scooby-Doo! and the Loch Ness Monster | 3/10 | It's not without some high moments, but overall it's incredibly forgettable with terrible animation and a predictable mystery. |
| Aloha, Scooby-Doo! | 5/10 | Well... It has some things going for it. The first half is very slow, but by the end it picks up. Side characters are infuriatng. Some people might like the songs. |
| Scooby-Doo! in Where's My Mummy? |  |  |
| Scooby-Doo! Pirates Ahoy! |  |  |
| Chill Out, Scooby-Doo! |  |  |
| Scooby-Doo! and the Goblin King | 3/10 | Mostly boring with some highlights. Bonus points for being set on Halloween. The animation is strangely better than some of the more modern ones. The songs are truly atrocious. Tries too hard to be funny. Incredibly disappointed that it's so bad despite a cameo from Tim Curry and... Jay Leno, for some reason. |
| Scooby-Doo! and the Samurai Sword |  |  |
| Scooby-Doo! Abracadabra-Doo | 6/10 | It's good. It's not great. Velma's sister is a jewel, and her interactions with Shaggy are the best part of the movie. I guessed the ending in the first 10 minutes. |
| Scooby-Doo! Camp Scare | 9/10 | Want a Scooby-Doo where you will almost certainly not guess the end? This is the one you want. Amazing animation, great songs, actual character development. I can't easily describe why I like this so much, but in the past month I've watched it a dozen times. |
| Scooby-Doo! Legend of the Phantosaur | 5/10 |  Well, I wanted to like it, but it's extremely average. It tries to make a unique attempt on familiar patterns, like Velma romance, but they don't quite work. Animation, music, themes. Better than some of the older ones, but nothing special. I probably won't watch it again. |
| Scooby-Doo! Music of the Vampire |  |  |
| Big Top Scooby-Doo! |  |  |
| Scooby-Doo! Mask of the Blue Falcon | 6/10 | It's self-aware, so that gives pretty good marks from me. At times, it's depressing, but at other times it's funny. Solid middle of the road entry. |
| Scooby-Doo! Adventures: The Mystery Map |  |  |
| Scooby-Doo! Stage Fright |  |  |
| Scooby-Doo! WrestleMania Mystery | 7/10 | I like it more then I expected. If you are familar with WWE you will probably eat this one up. If you don't like WWE, but you do like Scooby Doo... give it a chance. It's better then you'd expect. |
| Scooby-Doo! Frankencreepy | 9/10 | Divisive. Some people will love it, others will hate it because it has its own fast-paced style. I loved it. Seeing Velma's character explored more made me so happy. |
| Scooby-Doo! Moon Monster Madness | 6/10 | It's Scooby-Doo in space, so I wanted to love it but my enjoyment was marred by a few things - everyone was shitting on Velma, its very unique sense of humor sometimes didn't work for me, and poor pacing. Otherwise, it was delightfully weird. In fact, this one is worth watching because it is just so...different. But in a good way. |
| Scooby-Doo! and Kiss: Rock and Roll Mystery | 8/10 | This thing is ... just wild. I love it. The songs are fantastic (of course), the mystery is interesting and not completely predictable. It doesn't take itself too seriously and the animation is great, overall. | 
| Lego Scooby-Doo! Haunted Hollywood |  |  | 
| Scooby-Doo! and WWE: Curse of the Speed Demon |  |  |
| Scooby-Doo! Shaggy's Showdown | 7/10 | A good premise! We get to learn about Shaggy, and see the cast doing some new things. I enjoyed the songs, but some of the characters were infuriatingly annoying, and this one feels like its targeted at a younger audience. |
| Lego Scooby-Doo! Blowout Beach Bash |  |  |
| Scooby-Doo! & Batman: The Brave and the Bold | 8/10 | Batman and Scooby-Doo at their best. Self-appreciating, self-aware. Jokes that are actually funny. High quality animation. Granted it's a little bit weird seeing Velma just blindly accept superheroes when she is usually so skeptical. Whole lot of action in this one, to be expected because Batman. They did a great job of integrating the Scooby-Doo tropes with Batman to make them fresh. |
| Scooby-Doo! and the Gourmet Ghost |  |  |
| Scooby-Doo! and the Curse of the 13th Ghost | 7/10 | I didn't watch the original series, so I think I missed out a bit. The story itself is quite good, and there are many genuinely funny jokes. I just wished there was a bit more - it stopped short of reaching the excellence of some of the other movies. |
| Scooby-Doo! Return to Zombie Island |  | |
| Scoob! | 6/10 | May be the cutest thing I've seen in my life even if the animation reminds me disturbingly of claymation. Not having Matthew Lillard as shaggy makes me irrationally angry. I was impressed how they managed to integrate jokes for kids with jokes that adults would get. They explore new definitions of the group's dynamics that I don't think I've seen before. despite the good, I probably wouldn't watch it again, because it was emotional, but not very fun. |
| Happy Halloween, Scooby-Doo! | 5/10 | Terrible music. Lots of various crossovers that don't lend much to the story and a very "stranger things" vibe. Also, I've never seen Daphne so annoying. Despite all of that, I appreciate the return to the classic Scooby-Doo formula with the tropes we know and love. I'd say this one is only worth watching if you have kids, or if it happens to be on TV. Or if you love Bill Nye. |
| (Live Action) Scooby-Doo | 6/10 | In what crazy world is Lillard the best actor? He is so expressive and hilarious and the sets are a amazing. Unfortunately there's also nightmare fuel CG and awful music, and most of the other actors are boring and not really funny or interesting. |
| (Live Action) Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed | 3/10 | There are only two good things about this movie: Seth Green and Lillard. Velma feels more like Buffy with all her fighting. |
| (Live Action) Scooby-Doo! The Mystery Begins |  |  |
| (Live Action) Scooby-Doo! Curse of the Lake Monster |  |  |
| (Live Action) Daphne & Velma |  |  |
