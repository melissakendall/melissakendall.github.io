I watched an amazing [conference presentation](https://youtu.be/oqp0joQmazE) this week.

It struck a chord with me because it seemed to apply to creative writing, especially
dealing with hitting the wall when working on a project. So, I've compiled a list of
how the strategies in that presentation apply to creative writing.

## Ways to cope when you hit the wall

1. Accept that hitting the wall is not a flaw, it is a natural part of the project life cycle.
2. Ask for encouragement from other writers.
3. Vent to other writers.
4. Ask for help with brainstorming or world building.
5. Celebrate how far you've come
6. Create mini goals (1000 words, 5 chapters, 10 days of writing in a row), and celebrate them.
7. Take days off from writing, use those days to catch up on non-writing activities.
8. At the beginning of each writing session, check how much energy you have and choose tasks 
   that mesh with that energy.
9. Make your goals flexible. Committing to a certain number of words a day can feel great, but
   sticking to it if you don’t have the energy can be demotivating. Choose multiple goals for
   a writing sprint (100 words, 500 words, 1000 words) so you have options.
   Success looks different each day.
10. Reflect on what went well in each session, or at the end of the week.
11. At the beginning of each session, acknowledge that you’ve chosen to write. Remind yourself
    that you have agency and choice.
12. Change writing locations, take three deep breaths, change something.
13. Make a list of things that bring you joy, such as positive feedback from other writers, and
    when you get discouraged, bring it out and choose something.
